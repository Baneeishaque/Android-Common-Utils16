**Build once. Run anywhere. Audit always.**

**Reproducible builds. Explicit automation. Friendly onboarding.**

---

## ðŸ›  Overview

This repository delivers:

- **Crossâ€‘platform** CI/CD pipelines with guardrails and audits
- **Oneâ€‘command setup** for runtimes and tooling via mise
- **Clear documentation** and onboarding diagrams for contributors

## ðŸ’¬ Why This Project

We obsess over:

- **Zero guesswork**: every environment is explicit and reproducible
- **Fast onboarding**: scripts and diagrams turn newcomers into contributors in minutes
- **Bulletproof automation**: pinned versions, guard checks, and live audits baked in

## ðŸ“Œ About

This project is built for **clarity, reproducibility, and resilience**:

- Modular, **crossâ€‘platform** CI/CD pipelines.
- Explicit guards, **live audit signals**, and safe automation.
- Contributorâ€‘friendly onboarding with wellâ€‘documented scripts.

## Quick Start

This project uses a modular, crossâ€‘platform CI setup powered by PowerShell 5.1+/7+ and mise. All pipeline setup, build, and teardown logic lives in `ci/` with clear docs, diagrams, and troubleshooting tips.

To get started:

1. **Read `ci/README.md`** â€” it explains:
    - What each CI script does (`common.ps1`, `setup-mise-java.ps1`, `gradle-stop.ps1`)
    - How they link together in Azure Pipelines
    - Visual flow & sequence diagrams
    - Selfâ€‘test commands you can run locally
2. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have PowerShell installed (Core or Windows), plus Homebrew (macOS/Linux) or Scoop (Windows) if youâ€™re testing locally.
3. **Run a full setup with audits**:

    ```powershell
    pwsh ./ci/setup-mise-java.ps1
    ```

4. **Build with**:

    ```powershell
    ./gradlew build
    ```

5. **Stop the Gradle daemon**:

    ```powershell
    pwsh ./ci/gradle-stop.ps1
    ```

ðŸ’¡ These scripts are selfâ€‘auditing â€” check the log for PATH changes, Java pins, and Gradleâ€™s detected JDK.
